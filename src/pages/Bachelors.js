        I graduated with a <strong>3.81 GPA</strong> (Summa Cum Laude) and made the <strong>Deanâ€™s List 4 out of 6 semesters</strong>. I was inducted into the <strong>Psi Chi Honor Society</strong> for academic excellence in psychology.

        From October 2020 to May 2022, I participated in competitive tournaments like the State Debate Finals and the FIFA Dialogue Series. As VP, I mentored new members and rebranded our online presence, helping the club expand reach and improve rankings.

        I co-founded the South Asian Club to bring visibility to our cultures on campus through dance, food festivals, and awareness events. From hosting Holi celebrations to sari draping tutorials, we built spaces where representation felt joyful, not performative.
