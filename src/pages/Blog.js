        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Most people wait until they feel confident before they act, but confidence is usually the result of action, not the prerequisite. It’s the courage to start when your voice shakes. It’s the willingness to show up imperfect, to take the first step into discomfort, that creates true momentum. In my leadership experiences, I’ve rarely felt "ready" at the beginning. But I’ve learned that waiting for confidence is a delay tactic. Courage is what lets us speak up in a silent room, apply for the job we think we’re unqualified for, and advocate for ourselves and others. Confidence shows up after, it’s the echo of consistent courage.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-300 mb-2">Belonging isn’t just a DEI checkbox.</h3>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Belonging is not a bullet point in a presentation, it’s lived, felt, and constantly re-earned. It’s about whether someone learns to pronounce your name, whether your silence is acknowledged instead of dismissed, and whether your contribution is credited in a meeting. I’ve felt the difference between being included and being valued. Organizations often check DEI boxes without questioning culture, behavior, and bias. But true belonging means asking, “Whose voice is missing?” and being intentional about who is supported to speak. The best workplaces build a culture where you don’t just show up, you stay, grow, and thrive.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-300 mb-2">Not feeling Indian enough or American enough.</h3>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Being a third-culture kid often means not fitting neatly into boxes. You carry pieces of both cultures and often feel like you’re in-between. I’ve struggled with speaking up in rooms where my accent shifts. I’ve been told I’m too Indian to be American, too American to be Indian. But identity isn’t either/or, it’s layered, lived, and evolving. Today, I find pride in embracing both. I bring my culture into everything I do: through dance, language, community-building, and storytelling. Cultural identity is not static, it’s a bridge, a celebration, and a reflection of resilience.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-300 mb-2">Peer mentorship as real leadership.</h3>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          We often equate leadership with authority, titles, decisions, and big presentations. But I’ve found that some of the most powerful leadership happens in quiet moments. When you check in on someone after a tough shift. When you help a new team member figure out their first task. When you offer to sit beside them during their first event. Peer mentorship builds connection, reduces anxiety, and builds a culture of support. It doesn’t need a spotlight. It just needs intention. In all my roles, I’ve focused on showing up for people, listening, and helping them feel like they belong. That, to me, is leadership.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-300 mb-2">Unlearning 'strong means silent.'</h3>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          I used to believe that being strong meant not needing help. That asking questions was a weakness, and needing support meant I wasn’t ready. But strength is not silence. It’s not endurance without expression. I’ve learned that sharing my needs, asking for space, and opening up to others is where strength truly lives. Especially in leadership, we need to normalize vulnerability, not as oversharing, but as honesty. Because when leaders show up with authenticity, others follow. We create safer teams. We model trust. And we allow others to say, “Me too.” That’s the leadership I want to practice.
