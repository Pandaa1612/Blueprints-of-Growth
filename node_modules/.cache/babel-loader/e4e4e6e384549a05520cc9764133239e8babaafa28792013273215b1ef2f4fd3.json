My leadership style is bold, curious, and grounded in the belief that systems should support people — not the other way around. Since 2019, my story has been one of transition, trust, and transformation. Through research, relationships, and relentless effort, I aim to humanize workplaces, amplify underrepresented voices, and leave every space better than I found it.\n</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Bachelors() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"p-12\">\n      <h2 className=\"text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-blue-800\">Bachelor's Journey</h2>\n      <img src=\"/bachelors.jpg\" alt=\"Bachelor's Highlights\" className=\"mx-auto mb-6 rounded-lg shadow-md\" />\n\n      <p className=\"text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6\">\n        <span className=\"block text-xl font-bold text-blue-700 mb-1\">Academic Excellence</span>\n        I graduated summa cum laude with a 3.81 GPA and earned Dean’s List honors four times during my Psychology degree.

As Vice President and Social Media Head, I designed campaigns that attracted dozens of new members. I represented our university in the state tournament and the FIFA-hosted academic league, advocating for equity, ethics, and human behavior.\n      </p>\n\n      <p className=\"text-lg leading-relaxed\">\n        <span className=\"block text-xl font-bold text-blue-700 mb-1\">Cultural Impact</span>\n        I co-founded the South Asian Club because I saw how many South Asian students felt disconnected.

I founded the group because I wanted graduate students from South Asian backgrounds to have a place to feel proud, expressive, and visible. We practiced in common rooms, performed at campus showcases, and ended up winning iFest 2025. Our team grew from 4 to 20 dancers and became a symbol of joy, community, and power. I led rehearsals, managed our executive board, and mentored our dancers across different cultures and skill levels.\n      </p>\n\n      <p className=\"text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6\">\n        <span className=\"block text-xl font-bold text-blue-700 mb-1\">Graduate Assistant – OGISL</span>\n        Hired in my very first semester, I’ve supported onboarding for 500+ graduate students, created training guides for new hires, and planned major university events. From Winter Ball to Disney Spring Break trips, I’ve worked behind the scenes on logistics, inclusive planning, and student engagement. I co-led team onboarding, collaborated across departments, and reimagined how students transition into grad life.\n      </p>\n\n      <p className=\"text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6\">\n        <span className=\"block text-xl font-bold text-blue-700 mb-1\">SHRM Head of Relations & Summer HR Intern</span>\n        Through SHRM, I coordinated HR guest speaker panels, hosted workshops on job readiness, and helped grow our student network.
